Homework Assignment 1:

1. Create a console program  (choose .net framework over .net core)

2. Create a program that has different functions and depending on the choice the user picks, run that
routine/funtion.

So have a list of choices in the Console.WriteLine().  Functions 1-3.

Function 1:
This function asks a user to enter a number and loop that number n times.


Function 2:
This function will run a loop a random number of times.
*Use Random object.    
EX.  Random rand = new Random(seed value or leave empty)
int randomNumber = rand.Next(minNumber, MaxNumber);

then use the randomNumber for the loop condition.


Function 3:
This funtion will ask the user to enter a number between 1 and 3.

if 1 is selected, then show a loop that says "Hello" 1 time.
If 2 is selected, then show a loop that says "hello" 2 times.
If 3 is selected, then show a loop that says "hello" 3 times.
